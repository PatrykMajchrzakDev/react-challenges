Your taks is to build transfer list component

A transfer list allows users to pass items from one list to another.
UX mockup is provided.

The transfer list should consist of two lists with directional transfer buttons.
The user should be able to select one or multiple items and move items to the other list
by clicking the action buttons.

//Challenge is finished. If I had to manipulate input data I would change data to objects in an array and each object would have probably like 3 props
//data = [{value: "Item 1", list: "Left", checked: false}]
//the above data variable would be simple representation of how I would change initial input
